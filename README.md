# Bank API

## Description
In this project, I have created a simple bank API that allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money,
and transfer money between accounts.
The API is built using Spring boot  and Hibernate and uses a Postgres database to store user and account information.

## Requirements
To run the project you need to have the following installed on your machine:
- docker
- docker-compose

## Running the project
in the root directory of the project, run the following command:
```shell
docker-compose up
```
This will start the Postgres database and the Spring boot application.


## API Endpoints
The APIs are documented using Swagger and can be accessed at the following URL:
